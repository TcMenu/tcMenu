# JavaFX UI that connects using tcMenuAPI

Contained in this package is a JavaFX user interface that can connect to a remote device running tcMenu using either a serial port or ethernet.

To get started with this just create a project in your favourite Java IDE and import the maven file `pom.xml`.

Run it by starting the `SimpleFxApp` class. It should work on any desktop platform.

You can simply try this by building the `remoteControlSerial` example packaged with the tcMenu library.

This is not designed to be a full product, but rather to show a starting point of how to use the Java API.
